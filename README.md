# Responsive Portfolio

## Description

My portfolio displaying my information, projects, and contact details. Each project shown in the portfolio will have information on what was completed with the project, and a link to the website and git repo where applicable. The portfolio takes advantage of responsive design in order to be usable and visually appealing on a variety of screen sizes and devices.
